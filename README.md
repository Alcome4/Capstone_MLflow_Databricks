### Wildfire Prediction Capstone Project

### Introduction
This project focuses on predicting the estimated fire area of potential Australian wildfires using weather data from NASA. Built on **Databricks**, a unified analytics platform, the project leverages **MLFlow** to manage the entire machine learning lifecycle. We use weather data, vegetation index, land classes, and wildfire records to predict fire areas, employing **AutoML** for model selection and evaluation.

### Problem Statement
Australia regularly experiences devastating bushfires, with the 2020 wildfire season leading to significant loss of life, wildlife, and property. Understanding and predicting wildfire areas can help in resource allocation and emergency planning. Our goal is to build a machine learning model that forecasts the area of wildfires using historical data to mitigate future impacts.

### Dataset
We use IBM's ‘Predicting Wildfires with Weather Forecast Data’ challenge dataset, which consists of 15 years of weather and wildfire data (2005-2020) generated by NASA. Our target is the **‘Estimated_fire_area’**, and the analysis focuses on fires in Australia in February 2021.

### System Architecture
- **Platform**: Databricks, with Delta Lake for data storage and Spark tables for processing.
- **Model Management**: MLFlow manages machine learning experiments and model lifecycle.
- **Feature Engineering**: Key features were extracted from weather and vegetation data, with correlations and Granger Causality tests helping identify 23 influential variables.
- **AutoML**: Databricks AutoML tested models, including ARIMA and Prophet, to forecast wildfire areas.

### Machine Learning Pipeline
1. **Exploratory Data Analysis**: Data health checks, missing value treatments, and outlier detection.
2. **Feature Engineering**: Multicollinearity reduction and causality analysis.
3. **Modeling**: Time-series forecasting using AutoML, comparing models using the SMAPE metric.
4. **Model Registry**: Best models from each region were registered in MLFlow.
5. **Batch Inference**: Final models were used to forecast fire areas on unseen data.

### Conclusion
This project provides a scalable, automated solution for wildfire prediction, leveraging cutting-edge tools like Databricks and MLFlow for efficient model management and forecasting. The solution enhances disaster preparedness and resource allocation for future wildfires.
